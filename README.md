Background job queueing using TCPSocket. Inspired in the [Stalker gem](https://github.com/han/stalker).

Queueing jobs
-------------

From anywhere in your app:

~~~.ruby
require "hawking"

hawking = Hawking::Queue.new

hawking.put("email.send", to: "joe@example.com")
hawking.put("post.cleanup", id: post.id)
~~~

Working jobs
------------

In a standalone file, typically jobs.rb or worker.rb:

~~~.ruby
require "hawking"

Hawking::Job.put("email.send") do |data|
  Pony.send(to: data[:to], subject: 'Hello there')
end

Hawking::Job.put("post.cleanup") do |data|
  Post.find(data[:id]).cleanup
end
~~~

Running
-------

Hawking:

    $ gem install hawking

Now run a worker using the binary:

    $ hawking jobs.rb
    Working 2 jobs: [ email.send post.cleanup ]

    Working send.email ({:to=>joe@example.com})
    Working post.cleanup ({:id=>1})

Hawking will log to stdout as it starts working each job.

Running the tests
-----------------

    $ rake spec
